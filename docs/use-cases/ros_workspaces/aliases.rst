Standard RTW Aliases
=====================

Standard RTW aliases are configured out-of-the-box and they enable you to use the same command independently of the workspace you are in and help you hide ``colcon`` complexities and minimize errors when interacting with it.
The aliases set for each workspace (see :ref:`·πÅanaging multiple workspaces <tutorial-managing-multiple-workspaces>`) setup environment variables so that following aliases can interact with that specific workspace.


Explanation of Standard Aliases
--------------------------------
The standard aliases are callable from any folder as long as a workspace is sourced using ``_<workspace_name>`` alias.

.. note:: To make this reading short, Dr. Denis' favorite aliases are ``cb``, ``ca`` and ``crm`` - simply start with using those.


Entering Workspace Folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
rosd [<package_name>]
  Enter the root directory of the ROS workspace.
  Alias for command: ``cd $ROS_WS``
  If you add argument ``<package_name>``, ``rosd`` enters the source folder of that package.
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*

rosds
  Enter ``src`` directory of the ROS workspace.
  Alias for command: ``cd $ROS_WS/src``

rosdb
  Enter ``build`` directory of the ROS workspace.
  Alias for command: ``cd $ROS_WS/build``

rosdi
  Enter ``install`` directory of the ROS workspace.
  Alias for command: ``cd $ROS_WS/install``


Installling dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _uc-aliases-dependencies:

rosdep_prep
  Updating the system and ``rosdep`` references before installing dependencies.

rosdepi
  Installing dependencies for the packages in ``$ROS_WS/src`` folder.
  Makes the ``rosdep`` command shorter and simpler to use: ``rosdep install -y -i --from-paths \$ROS_WS/src``


Building Packages in Workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every alias has optional package names. If none is provided the whole workspace is built.

cb [<package1_name>, <package2_name>]
  Building named packages or the whole workspace.
  Alias for command: ``colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo``.
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*

cbup <package1_name>
  Building all packages up to the named packages (build all dependencies).
  Alias for command: ``colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo --packages-up-to``.
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*

cbd [<package1_name>, <package2_name>]
  Building named packages or the whole workspace as *Debug* build type.
  Alias for command: ``colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug``.

cbr [<package1_name>, <package2_name>]
  Building named packages or the whole workspace as *Release* build type.
  Alias for command: ``colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``.


Executing Package Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every alias has optional package names. If none is provided the whole workspace is built.

ct [<package1_name>, <package2_name>]
  Testing named packages or the whole workspace.
  Alias for command: ``colcon test``.
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*

ctup <package_name>
  Testing named packages up to the named package (build all dependencies).
  Alias for command: ``colcon test --packages-up-to``.

ctres <package_name>
  Get test results for the whole workspace or a package. If using package, the output will be ``grep``-processed to filter-out the package you are looking for.
  Alias for command: ``colcon test-result --all``
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*


Executing Multiple Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every alias has optional package names. If none is provided the whole workspace is built.

ca [<package1_name>, <package2_name>]
  Build, test and show test results for the named packages or the whole workspace.
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*

caup <package_name>
  Build, test and show test results for the package and all its dependencies.
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*


Cleaning Workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

crm [<package1_name>, <package2_name>]
  Remove ``build``, ``log`` and ``install`` folders for the workspace or corresponding sub-folders for specific packages.
  *Auto-completion for all build ROS 2 packages is available.*


Defining Your Own Aliases
===========================

**TBD**

Idea: sharing aliases with your team that are very specific for your use-cases.
